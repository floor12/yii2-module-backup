This module helps to create and restore backups of databases and files stored on disk. It has web-interface, console commands, and REST-API for remote control. It also supports io-priority settings and has flexible configuration options. To work independent of the
 application database, this module uses its sqlite database in the backup folder.
 
### i18n
Now, this module supports English and Russian languages.
 
![Yii backup module](https://floor12.net/files/default/get?hash=4895685e3392ade4e0e2a40a762bc4fe)

## Installation

To add this module to your app, just run:

 ```bash
 $ composer require floor12/yii2-module-backup
 ```
or add this to the `require` section of your composer.json.
 ```json
 "floor12/yii2-module-backup": "dev-master"
 ```
 
 
 After that, include minimal module configuration in `modules` section of application config:
 ```php  
 'modules' => [
             'backup' => [
                 'class' => 'floor12\backup\Module',
                 'administratorRoleName' => '@',
                 'configs' => [
                     [
                         'id' => 'main_db',
                         'type' => BackupType::DB,
                         'title' => 'Main database',
                         'connection' => 'db',
                         'limit' => 10
                     ],
                     [
                         'id' => 'main_storage',
                         'type' => BackupType::FILES,
                         'title' => 'TMP folder',
                         'path' => '@app/tmp',
                         'limit' => 2
                     ]
                 ]
             ]
             ],
         ],
     ...
 ```

These parameters is possible to set up:
- `administratorRoleName` - role to access web controller
- `backupFolder` - path alias to the place where backups are stored (default is @app/backups)
- `chmod` -  if this param has value, the new backup file will change mode after creation
- `authTokens` - array of auth tokens to use REST-API of the module
- `ionice` - the value of this param will be placed before ZIP console command in case of disk backup (for example it's possible to put
 `iotince
 -c3` inside this param to run backup creation with IDLE disk i/o priority)
 - `adminLayout` - it will change default `main` layout to something you need (if your admin panel has different base layout)
 
 And the main and required param is`configs` - its an array of your backup items (folders and databases).
 Each backup items mast have this elements to set:
 - `id` - backup identifier, contains only letters and numbers without space
 - `type` - type backup: disk or database
 - `title` - human-readable backup item title to show in the admin interface
 - `limit` - how many backup copies keep before delete (`0` - never delete old copies)
 - `connection` - in case of database backup, connection name in Yii2 config 
 - `path` - in case of disk backup, the path to store backup files
 
    
## Usage

### WEB interface

This module has a web controller to work with backups. Go to `backup/admin` or `backup/admin/index` to create, delete, restore and download
 backups.
 
 ### Console interface
 
*To list all existing backups run*
 ```bash
$ ./yii backup/console/index>
```

*To create config run*
 ```bash
$ ./yii backup/console/create <backup_config_id>
```
`backup_config_id` is backup item identifier from module configuration.


*To restore config run*
 ```bash
$ ./yii backup/console/restore <backup_id>
```
`backup_id` is identifier of backup stored in sqlite database

### REST-api

By default, rest controller takes place on the route `/backup/api`.
To get access to it, add header `Backup-Auth-Token` to request with one of the tokens stored in application config in the module section
 (param `authTokens`);



#### Get list of backups
`GET /backup/api/index` 

This is useful to remote backup checks from some dashboard with a few projects.

Response example:
```json
[
  {
    "id": 8,
    "date": "2019-11-11 07:02:23",
    "status": 1,
    "type": 1,
    "config_id": "main_storage",
    "config_name": "TMP folder",
    "filename": "main_storage_2019-11-11_07-02-23.zip",
    "size": 4183
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "date": "2019-11-11 06:56:36",
    "status": 1,
    "type": 0,
    "config_id": "main_db",
    "config_name": "Main database",
    "filename": "main_db_2019-11-11_06-56-36.gz",
    "size": 753
  },

]
```

```json
{"result":"success"}
```

#### Delete backup
`DELETE /backup/api/delete?id=<backup_id>` 

Succes respons example:
```json
{"result":"success"}
```

#### Get backup file
